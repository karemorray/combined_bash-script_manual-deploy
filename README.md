# combined_bash-script_manual-deploy
This script will give you a choice to enter the file name for deployment, here I have 2 files called 'admin' and 'client' and their respective paths where to deploy on Nginx server.
After entering the file name the script will deploy the code in appropriate path/s on server.
You will need to tweak the path/s in the script to work in environment.
